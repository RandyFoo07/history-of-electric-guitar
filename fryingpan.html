                <p class="main-section-text main-fryingpan-text">
                    The first of its kind, the Rickenbacker Electro A-22, or more commonly known as the "Frying Pan",
                    was designed to capitalize on the popularity of Hawaiian music in the 1930s. <br><br>
                    To solve the volume problems faced by acoustic guitars, microphones were placed in front of them,
                    only
                    to be met by screeching sounds due to the output flowing right back into the microphone. <br><br>
                    Early attempts at electrically amplifying the sound of strings were made on violins and banjos in
                    the 1910s.
                    They were however unsuccessful as the output produced was too low. <br><br>
                    George Beauchamp was aware of the low volume that the acoustic guitar possess, and the important
                    role it has
                    on Hawaiian music. He produced a loud enough volume using magnetic pickups on his acoustic guitar
                    but was
                    disappointed by the amount of unwanted noise as an effect of it. He then met Rickenbacker, who owned
                    a company
                    that produced aluminium resonators and brass bodies for instruments. They designed a lap steel
                    guitar with a
                    solid aluminium circular body and a long neck, resembling a frying pan.
