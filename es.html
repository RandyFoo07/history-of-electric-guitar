                <p class="main-section-text main-es-text">
                    Gibson Guitar Corporation initially developed an electromagnetic pickup, similar to the ones used in
                    the Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts, except in a bar shape. The shape led to it being called the
                    bar pickup, and was used on their lap steel guitar models and later acoustic models. <br><br>
                    Seeing the success of their bar pickup implementation, Montgomery Ward and Spiegel May Stern pitched
                    the idea of placing the pickups on a Spanish style guitar, which ultimately led to the production of
                    the ES-150 in 1936. <br><br>
                    The ES-150 was renowned for its 150USD selling price and tone that was preferred by jazz and blues
                    guitar players. The placement of the bar pickup and the overall construction provided the volume
                    that
                    jazz guitar players in large orchestras yearned for. Its popularity was further increased by the
                    endorsement of famous guitar players at the time, most notably Charlie Christian. <br><br>
                    Due to how the bar pickups were manufactured and the hollow body of the guitar, the ES-150 was
                    susceptible
                    to a large amount of electromagnetic hum and unwanted feedback, despite being a massive improvement
                    on
                    previous iterations. However, it still left a prominent mark in the guitar industry.
