            <p class="main-section-text" id="main-dilemma-text">With the rise in popularity of orchestras and jazz
                ensembles in the 1920s,
                acoustic guitar players would soon
                realize the insufficient amount of volume that their instruments were producing.<br><br> This
                affected
                jazz players whom wanted the sound of single notes to be heard clearly during big band ensembles.
                <br><br>Thus, the demand for guitar volume amplification rose and attempts to solve the problem were
                made by many.

                    and carbon button
                    microphones to amplify the vibration of string instruments by placing it on their acoustic bodies,
                    the
                    first
                    commercially successful attempt was made in 1932. <br><br>
                    George Beauchamp alongside with partner Paul Barth made the first electrically amplified aluminium

                    Due to the success of the "Frying Pan", George Beauchamp and Paul Berth worked with Adolph
                    Rickenbacker, a large contributor to their prior project, to produce the Electro-Spanish Ken
                    Roberts, a guitar that is made out of solid wood.
                    <br><br>
                    The design of the guitar was revolutionary at the time, featuring design elements that is passed
                    down to guitars even to this current day.

                    Following the footsteps of Rickenbacker, many manufacturers started to come to the scene. Gibson
                    Guitar Corporation, a well-known acoustic company at the time, produced their first ever electric
                    guitar -
                    ES-150. The 'ES' stands for Electric Spanish and the '150' was the price in USD of the instrument
                    itself.
                    <br><br>
                    It quickly gained popularity among jazz players in orchestras, as it was loud enough to stand out on
                    its own.
                    However, it still left something to be desired as there were unequal loudness across its six
                    strings.

                    Despite Gibson's countless prototypes on what would be the first solid-body style electric guitar,
                    they failed
                    to make any significant impact on the market, as they themselves believe that the guitar would not
                    succeed.
                    <br><br>
                    Leo Fender sought to improve on the ES-150, as it contained great volume but lacked in the tonal
                    department,
                    by developing a prototype of his own. Started as a crude wooden guitar to test electronic pickups,
                    Fender
                    soon discovered its bright and sustaining sound. After a few more revisions, it became one of the
                    most successfully mass
                    produced electric
                    guitar in history.
