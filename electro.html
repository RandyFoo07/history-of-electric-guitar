                <p class="main-section-text main-electro-text">
                    Seeing the fruits of their labour, George Beauchamp, Paul Barth and Adolph Rickenbacker formed
                    a partnership and created the Rickenbacker Electro Stringed Instrument Company, formerly known as
                    the Ro-Pat-In Corporation. <br><br>
                    In 1935, they released the first full-scale electric guitar in the world, Electro-Spanish Ken
                    Roberts,
                    named after Ken Roberts whom was a friend of George Beauchamp. <br><br>
                    The guitar featured a semi-hollow mahogany body, an extended neck joining the body at the 17th fret,
                    and a stock appointed tremolo arm that was designed and patented by Doc Kauffman. Its revolutionary
                    design enable for playability that was never achieved in electric guitars before, and would inspire
                    popular companies such as Fender and Gibson to utilize the design for their guitars even to this
                    current
                    day. <br><br>
                    The Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts was designed to be played standing up
                    while
                    strapped on the body, unlike its predecessor the "Frying Pan", which was played in the 'Hawaiian
                    style'
                    or on the lap. To this day, it is considered to be the first modern electric guitar ever
                    produced.
