                <p class="main-section-text main-tele-text">
                    With several guitar companies and the like trying to tinker with solid-body electric guitars, Leo
                    Fender set
                    out to create one of his own. In 1943, together with Doc Kauffman, the person who designed the
                    tremolo arm on
                    the
                    Electro-Spanish guitar, they built a simple wooden guitar simply for testing pickups. The end result
                    was a bright and clear sound similar to electric Hawaiian guitars, but without the unwanted feedback
                    due to its solid body nature.<br><br>
                    After several iterations of prototypes, Leo Fender ended up with a guitar that consisted of only two
                    main pieces, the solid body of the guitar and its bolted-on neck. It was first introduced to the
                    public
                    as the Fender Esquire, later modified to a two-pickup model and reintroduced separately as the
                    Broadcaster.<br><br>
                    Legal action over the name 'Broadcaster' prompted the logo itself to be removed from the headstock
                    of the
                    guitars, which left only the 'Fender' logo to be seen. The term 'Nocaster' was given to specifically
                    those
                    guitars until Fender renamed it to the 'Telecaster' in 1951 and has stuck with it ever since.
                    <br><br>
                    The telecaster was one of the very few guitars that retained its initial design throughout the
                    years,
                    and still remained to be one of the most popular guitars now.
